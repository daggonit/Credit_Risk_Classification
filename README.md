# Credit_Risk_Classification

An overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
The goal was to predict the status of a loan ( if it was healthy or unhealthy) based on the data used to train the model.

The results: Using a bulleted list, describe the accuracy score, the precision score, and recall score of the machine learning model.

Negative Class (0):
    -Precision: 1.00
The model is perfectly accurate when predicting the negative class. Every time it predicts a negative loan, it is correct.
    -Recall: 1.00
The model correctly identifies all actual negative loans. There are no false negatives in this class.
    -F1-score: 1.00
The F1-score is perfect, reflecting both perfect precision and recall for the negative class. 

Positive Class (1):
    -Precision: 0.87
When the model predicts a loan is positive (high-risk), it is correct 87% of the time. This indicates some false positives are present.
    -Recall: 0.91
The model correctly identifies 91% of the actual positive loans, meaning it misses 9% of them (false negatives).
    -F1-score: 0.89
The F1-score reflects a balance between precision and recall, showing the overall effectiveness in predicting positive loans.

A summary: Summarize the results from the machine learning model. Include your justification for recommending the model for use by the company. If you donâ€™t recommend the model, justify your reasoning.

The model is extremely accurate in predicting the correct Nagative Class with a 100% F1 Score. However, when predicting the Positive Class the model has an F1 Score of 89%. This may be due to the low amount of training data for that category, although 89% is still very high. Overall, the high accuracy and strong average metrics indicate that the model is highly effective in distinguishing between the two classes (99%), with a very low rate of misclassification.
